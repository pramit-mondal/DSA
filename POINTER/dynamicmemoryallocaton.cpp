/*Static Memory-Static Memory Allocation, also known as Compile-time Memory Allocation, is used for the allocation of memory during the process of compilation of data in a fixed size. The compiler allocates memory for variables present in the program.*/
/*Dynamic memory-Dynamic Memory Allocation, also known as Run-time Memory Allocation, is used for the allocation of memory during the process of execution (Runtime) of data. It allows allocation to entities when the program is running for the first time.*/
